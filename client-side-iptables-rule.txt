#Enable IP-Forwarding at Client side machine in my case it is Linux

nano /etc/sysctl.conf
net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
sudo sysctl -p

#Recommended rule for Client A firewall
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -d 192.168.10.0/24 -j MASQUERADE

#Add above rule in /etc/rc.local at the end of file and save
chmod +x /etc/rc.local
